# editor4roks
### Description
Plugin that adds the WYSIWYG HTML Editor to the custom descriptions of **[Roksprocket](http://www.rockettheme.com/wordpress/plugins/roksprocket)** Modules/Widgets.

With editor4roks the descriptions will be easier to edit and the links easier to put directly on the modules/widgets.



This is not an official plugin of **[RocketTheme](https://rockettheme.com/)**.

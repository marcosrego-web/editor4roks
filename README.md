# editor4roks
Plugin that adds the WYSIWYG HTML Editor to the custom descriptions of Roksprocket Modules/Widgets.

With editor4roks the descriptions will be easier to edit and the links easier to put directly on the modules/widgets.



Tested on WordPress with the editors: TinyMCE and TinyMCE Advanced.

Tested on Joomla with the editors: TinyMCE and JCE.


This is not an official plugin/module of RocketTheme.
